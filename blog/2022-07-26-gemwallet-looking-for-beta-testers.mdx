### Introduction

GemWallet has already presented its beta version in a previous article, but now are working hard on version 2.0.0.

You can find the last source code of version 2.0.0 on the [release/2.0.0 branch](https://github.com/GemWallet/gemwallet-extension/tree/release/2.0.0).

In this article, I am going to explain to you what changes in this version and what is planned on the TODO list before going to the Chrome Store.

### What's new?

ðŸŒ± Features:

1. Refactor transaction payment API

   - Make the payload simpler

2. Inform the user when the password is wrong
3. Allow the user to go to the previous page on import seed phrase or create a new wallet

### How to use it?

To use GemWallet, you need to use the GemWallet API described in the [documentation](/docs/user-guide/introduction).

Unfortunately, the documentation is not up to date as the package is still under development.

I am going to show you how to connect the version beta with the following code snippet:

```tsx
import { isConnected, sendPayment } from "@gemwallet/api";

export function Checkout() {
  const handlePayment = () => {
    // We make sure that we are connected to the ledger with the isConnected API
    isConnected().then((isConnected) => {
      if (isConnected) {
        const transaction = {
          amount: "0.999999",
          destination: "rNvFCZXpDtGeQ3bSas15wGLN6N2stGmA9o",
        };
        // We send the payment to the extension which will forward it to the XRP Ledger
        sendPayment(transaction)
          .then((trHash) => {
            // If the transaction is a success, the promise returns a transaction hash
            console.log("Transaction Hash: ", trHash);
          })
          .catch((e) => {
            console.log("THE ERROR: ", e);
          });
      } else {
        console.log("You are not connected");
      }
    });
  };

  return (
    <button
      onClick={handlePayment}
      className="mt-10 w-full bg-indigo-600 border border-transparent rounded-md py-3 px-8 flex items-center justify-center text-base font-medium text-white hover:bg-indigo-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500"
    >
      PAY
    </button>
  );
}
```

In order to don't pollute the npm repository of GemWallet the beta is under the package: [@gemwallet-beta/api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gemwallet-beta/api).

The code above is extracted from this repository where you can have an example of implementation: [https://github.com/FlorianBouron/gemwallet-store-demo/tree/release/2.0.0](https://github.com/FlorianBouron/gemwallet-store-demo/tree/release/2.0.0)
