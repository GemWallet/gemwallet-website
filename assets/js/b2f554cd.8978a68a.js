This made it relatively easy for people to build a reputation and for others to trust them online. However, as the internet has grown and become more complex, the idea of a single online identity has become increasingly problematic.\\n\\n### Web3 and multi-persona\\n\\nEnter web3 and the concept of multi persona.\\nWeb3 refers to the third generation of the internet, which is characterized by the use of decentralized technologies such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks. One of the key features of web3 is the ability for individuals to have multiple online identities, or \\"personas,\\" that they can use for different purposes, such as work, personal life, or specific online activities.\\n\\n### What does it bring?\\n\\nThis is a significant shift from the web2 model, where individuals typically had a single online identity that was tied to their real-world identity. With web3 and multi persona, individuals can create multiple online identities that are completely separate from their real-world identity, allowing them to engage in different activities online without having to worry about their reputation being tarnished.\\n\\nSo why is the ability to have multiple personas important? There are a few key reasons:\\n\\n1. Privacy: One of the biggest concerns with the internet is the lack of privacy. With web3 and multi persona, individuals can have multiple identities that they use for different purposes, allowing them to keep their personal information private and separate from their online activities.\\n2. Reputation management: In the web2 world, it was easy for individuals to build a reputation that was tied to their real-world identity. However, this could also be a liability if an individual made a mistake or engaged in activities that were not in line with their reputation. With web3 and multi persona, individuals can create separate identities for different activities, allowing them to manage their reputation more effectively.\\n3. Increased security: In the web2 world, individuals were often targeted by hackers who were able to gain access to their online accounts and steal sensitive information. With web3 and multi persona, individuals can create separate identities for different activities, making it more difficult for hackers to target them and increasing their overall security.\\n\\nOverall, the rise of web3 and multi persona is a significant shift in the way that individuals interact with the internet. It allows individuals to have greater control over their online identity and reputation, while also increasing their privacy and security. As web3 technologies continue to mature, it is likely that the use of multi persona will become increasingly common, fundamentally changing the way that we think about our online identities.\\n\\n### How to create and manage a multi-persona with GemWallet?\\n\\nIn order to add a new wallet click on the \\"Wallet Icon\\" button.\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\\"/img/GemWalletHomeScreen.png\\"\\n  alt=\\"GemWallet home screen\\"\\n  width=\\"300\\"\\n/>\\n\\n3. Click on the \\"Plus\\" button.\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\\"/img/GemWalletPlusButton.png\\"\\n  alt=\\"GemWallet add wallet button\\"\\n  width=\\"300\\"\\n/>\\n\\n4. Confirm your password, and then either \\"Create a new wallet\\" or \\"Import a new wallet\\".\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\\"/img/GemWalletAddWallet.png\\"\\n  alt=\\"GemWallet add a new wallet\\"\\n  width=\\"300\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### Steps to follow when creating multi-persona\\n\\nThere are several steps you can follow to create and manage a multi-persona:\\n\\n1. Determine your purpose: Decide what you want to use your multi-persona for and what aspects of your identity you want to separate. This will help you to decide which personas to create and how to manage them.\\n2. Create your personas: Create different wallets within GemWallet.\\n3. Use your different wallets for different purposes: To further separate your personas, use your wallets for different purposes. For exemple use one wallet for buying things for your home and another one to buy the gifts for your partner. This can help to prevent your personas from being linked together through shared IP addresses or other identifying information.\\n4. Be consistent: To maintain the integrity of your personas, be consistent in the information you provide and the activities you engage in with each one. This will help to prevent your personas from being linked together.\\n5. Regularly review and update: Periodically review and update your personas to ensure that they are still serving their intended purpose and are not being linked together.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can create and manage a multi-persona to maintain privacy and security online and separate different aspects of your online identity."},{"id":"import-xumm-wallets-into-gemwallet","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/import-xumm-wallets-into-gemwallet","editUrl":"https://github.com/GemWallet/gemwallet-website/blob/master/blog/2023-01-02-import-xumm-wallets-into-gemwallet.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-02-import-xumm-wallets-into-gemwallet.mdx","title":"Import XUMM wallets into GemWallet","description":"How to import my XUMM wallet to GemWallet?","date":"2023-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 2, 2023","tags":[{"label":"GemWallet","permalink":"/blog/tags/gem-wallet"},{"label":"Release 2.2.0","permalink":"/blog/tags/release-2-2-0"}],"readingTime":0.74,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Bouron","title":"Founder and Maintainer of GemWallet","url":"https://github.com/FlorianBouron","imageURL":"https://github.com/FlorianBouron.png","key":"florianb"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"import-xumm-wallets-into-gemwallet","title":"Import XUMM wallets into GemWallet","authors":"florianb","tags":["GemWallet","Release 2.2.0"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Web3 and the Rise of Multi-persona","permalink":"/blog/web3-and-the-rise-of-multi-persona"},"nextItem":{"title":"GemWallet looking for beta testers","permalink":"/blog/gemwallet-looking-for-beta-testers"}},"content":"### How to import my XUMM wallet to GemWallet?\\n\\nGemWallet allows you to import your secret keys into the extension.\\n\\nIf you want to import your secret keys from XUMM to GemWallet you will have to import your private keys and add them into GemWallet.\\n\\n1.

I have been working on GemWallet since November 2021.\\n\\nBelow, you can find a demo of an online payment made with GemWallet on the test net of the XRPL (XRP Ledger).\\nThe video may seem technical, but no worries, I am saying a few technical words for my developer audience.\\n\\n<iframe\\n  width=\\"560\\"\\n  height=\\"315\\"\\n  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRhOIPvGJ9w\\"\\n  title=\\"YouTube video player\\"\\n  frameborder=\\"0\\"\\n  allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"\\n  allowfullscreen\\n></iframe>\\n\\n### Why GemWallet?\\n\\nGemWallet is a web extension that allows you to make online\\npayments with one click on the XRPL. It also provides an API that\\nbridges web browsers to the blockchain, allowing developers to\\neasily build web3 applications integrated with XRP.\\nOur vision is really oriented toward payments, micro-payments, donations and\\npayment streaming. Tomorrow we could also support NFTs on XRPL and be a\\npart of the metaverse.\\n\\nWhen I was developing web3 applications on Ethereum and Solana, I\\nwas impressed by its user experience (Metamask, Phantom...) but\\nunfortunately, I couldn\'t find a similar experience on the XRPL.\\nAfter looking on the web, I found the video of\\n[Moralis with Wietse Wind talking about XUMM wallet](https://youtu.be/EfQEM9M23Sw?t=383)\\n. In this video, Wietse is saying that XUMM is a mobile\\napplication and is not focusing on the web. This is the missing\\nelement that GemWallet is addressing. On top of that, GemWallet is\\ngoing to help the ecosystem grow.\\nFor instance, GemWallet will be empowering streaming payments,\\nwhich could be a gate to:\\n\\n- Blog article subscription per second of reading\\n- Video streaming per second of watching\\n- Online classes per second of learning\\n\\nWe do need a bridge between our browser and the blockchain and\\nwe strongly believe the solution is GemWallet and the XRP Ledger.\\n\\n### Why the XRPL?\\n\\nOur vision is to enable crypto payments on the internet. We want to\\ncreate a world where crypto payments are easier and more secure. We believe XRPL is the most relevant one for several reasons:\\n\\n- Transfer fees are very low.\\n- It is fast and secure.\\n- XRPL is used by banking corporations (Bank of America, Saudi British Bank, Santander, American Express ...).\\n- XRPL is a carbon-neutral ledger, enhancing our core values.\\n\\n### What about the developer experience?\\n\\nDevelopers will be able to integrate to the XRPL much easier, which\\nwill bring more users to the XRP ledger and web3. Before starting the\\nproject I have discussed it with developers in the crypto industry and\\nthey confirmed that a wallet browser extension would solve the issue\\nof integrating the XRPL to the web3.\\n\\nAs well our code is fully open sourced, you can find it here: [https://github.com/GemWallet](https://github.com/GemWallet).\\n\\nIf you ever get stuck or need some help you can read our [FAQ](/faq) or see our [showcases](/showcase).\\n\\n### How about the roadmap?\\n\\nAs for now, GemWallet is available only on the XRPL testnet, we will release it on the mainnet pretty soon.\\n\\nHere is our closest roadmap (on the 9th of April 2022):\\n\\n- Publication of the extension in the Chrome Store\\n- Connect GemWallet to the mainnetConnect GemWallet to the mainnet\\n- Allow users to create a new wallet from GemWallet - currently supporting only importing wallets\\n- Support different wallets - currently supporting only one\\n- List user\'s tokens (other than XRP)\\n- Authorize payments to be done in other tokens (tokens supported by the XRPL)\\n- Ensure compatibility with Mozilla Firefox and not only with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge and Brave)\\n- Provide XUMM Wallet import to GemWallet - better experience within the XRP ecosystem\\n- Build an extension for WooCommerce\\n- Allow payment streaming\\n- And much more...\\n\\nWe would love contributors and testers!
