To get started, you'll need both the GemWallet extension and the API needed to integrate with it.

## Install the GemWallet extension.

You'll want a local version of the extension to test with.

Head over to the Chrome extension store and install GemWallet into your browser.

## Install GemWallet API

In order to communicate with the extension you need to use the [GemWallet API](/docs/api/gemwallet-api) that will let you send and receives messages from the extension.
