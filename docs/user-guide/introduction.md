## Welcome to GemWallet

Welcome to GemWalletâ€™s Developer Documentation. GemWallet is the bridge between the blockchain (XRPL) and fast payments over the internet. It is currently available as a browser extension (and much more soon). This documentation webpage illustrates how to use it.

If you want to know about our last updates and announcements, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gemwallet_app) and check out our [blog](/blog).

Once you've installed the extension and the API, familiarize yourself with how to integrate it, then head down to the Playground to test your connection with the extension.

## Why GemWallet

GemWallet makes fast secure online payments on the blockchain easier and more user-friendly.

Our vision is oriented toward payments, micro-payments, and donations.

## Blockchain Connection

GemWallet comes pre-loaded with fast connections to the Ripple (XRP) blockchain. This allows you to get started without synchronizing a full node, while still providing the option to upgrade your security and use the blockchain provider of your choice.

GemWallet is compatible with the XRP Ledger (XRPL). For development, we recommend running on a test blockchain.
