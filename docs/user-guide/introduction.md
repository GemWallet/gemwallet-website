## Welcome to GemWallet

Welcome to GemWalletâ€™s Developer Documentation. GemWallet is the bridge between blockchain and fast payments over the internet and experience on Web3 payments. It is currently available as a browser extension (and much more soon). The purpose of this documentation is to illustrate how to use it.

If you want to know about the our last updates and announcements, follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gemwallet_app) and our [blog](/blog).

Once you've installed the extension and the API, and you've familiarized yourself with how to integrate it, head down to the Playground to test your connection with the extension.

## Why GemWallet

GemWallet was created to make the fast secure online payments on blockchain, easier and more user friendly.

- Learn more about our [JavaScript Provider API](/docs/api/gemwallet-api).

## Blockchain Connection

GemWallet comes pre-loaded with fast connections to the Ripple (XRP) blockchain. This allows you to get started without synchronizing a full node, while still providing the option to upgrade your security and use the blockchain provider of your choice.

Today, GemWallet is compatible with the Ripple blockchain but other blockchain might be considered. For development, we recommend running on a test blockchain.
